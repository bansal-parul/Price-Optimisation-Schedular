# Price-Optimisation-Schedular
Price Optimasation Algorithm, winning solution for Tractor Supply's AI Hackathon. 

The data here is provided by Hackathon. 

The steps for determining the prices for a given month are as follows:
1. Obtain a relationship between demand, price and time : Estimate an equation between Demand and Price for each  SKU at weekly level 

2. Forecast sales : Forecast Demand for each SKU at weekly level using historical Demand data using Deep Learning using Temporal Fusion Transformer.
   
3. Optimise price with respect to forecast : Find Upper and lower limits of demand at weekly level
Find Optimal Price at weekly level, given Demand-Price Equation, and bounds on Demand forecast and Price.

4. Results : Bin the Optimal Price for each SKUâ€™s. For the consecutive weeks, where the bin price is changing, provide optimum price

Please see the TSC Pricing Optimisation.pptx for more details on the process.
